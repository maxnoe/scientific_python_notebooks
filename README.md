* [A workshop for Astronomers and Particle Physicists at IFAE and ICE](https://github.com/Python4AstronomersAndParticlePhysicists/PythonWorkshop-ICE)
* [The Second Asterics-Obelics School 2018](https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2018)
* [The Third Asterics-Obelics School 2019](https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2019)
* [Python Workshop GRK Uni Freiburg 2019](https://indico.cern.ch/event/846501)
* [Escape Data Science School 2021](https://github.com/escape2020/school2021)
* [Escape Data Science School 2022](https://github.com/escape2020/school2022)

And was put together and presented by [@kbruegge](https://github.com/kbruegge) and me.
